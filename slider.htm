                    '<p>The mountain is 4,076 metres (13,400 ft) above sea level and can be seen from places 200 kilometres (120 mi) away. The mount has the appearance of a prayer mat is and is thus named Musa Ka Musala, meaning Moses prayer mat. The mountain is icescaped all year long. The mountain top is considered a ziarat {Islamic shrine} by the localites, as a shepherd, in old times, used to offer his daily prayers at the peak. The mountain is surrounded by Khunda (Gali) Peak, which very much resembles K2.</p>',
                    '<p>Nanga Parbat is the ninth highest mountain on Earth and among the eight-thousanders with a summit elevation of 8,126 meters (26,660 ft). Nanga Parbat translates to "Naked Mountain" in English; parbat deriving from the Sanskrit word parvata meaning "mountain, rock", and nanga an Urdu word meaning "naked".[2] Known as the "Killer Mountain", Nanga Parbat was one of the deadliest of the eight-thousanders for climbers in the first half of the twentieth century; since that time it has been less so, though still an extremely serious climb.</p>' +
                    '<p>The core of Nanga Parbat is a long ridge trending southwest-northeast. The ridge is an enormous bulk of ice and rock. It has three faces, Diamir face, Rakhiot and Rupal. The southwestern portion of this main ridge is known as the Mazeno Wall, and has a number of subsidiary peaks. In the other direction, the main ridge arcs northeast at Rakhiot Peak (7,070 m / 23,196 ft). The south/southeast side of the mountain is dominated by the massive Rupal Face, noted above. The north/northwest side of the mountain, leading to the Indus, is more complex. It is split into the Diamir (west) face and the Rakhiot (north) face by a long ridge. There are a number of subsidiary summits, including North Peak (7,816 m / 25,643 ft) some 3 km north of the main summit. Near the base of the Rupal Face is a beautiful glacial lake called Latbo, above a seasonal shepherds village of the same name.</p>',
